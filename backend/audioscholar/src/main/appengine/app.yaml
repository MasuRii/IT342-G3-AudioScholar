# Specifies the App Engine environment (Standard or Flexible)
# and the runtime language/version.
runtime: java17 # Or java11, java21, depending on your project's Java version

# (Optional) Controls the instance class (machine type). 
# F1 is the smallest and part of the free tier. Others include F2, F4, etc.
instance_class: F1 

# (Optional but recommended) Entrypoint for executable JARs
# Replace 'your-app-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' with the actual name 
# of the JAR file generated by 'mvn package' (usually found in the 'target' directory).
# Note: For Spring Boot executable JARs on Java 11/17/21 standard runtimes, 
# App Engine often auto-detects the entrypoint, but specifying it is safer.
entrypoint: 'java -jar audioscholar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' # Use a wildcard if the version changes

# (Optional) Configure scaling settings. This is a basic auto-scaling example.
automatic_scaling:
  min_instances: 0       # Minimum number of instances (0 allows scaling to zero - cost-effective)
  max_instances: 1       # Maximum number of instances (adjust as needed)
  target_cpu_utilization: 0.65 # Target CPU usage before scaling up

# (Optional) Add environment variables
# env_variables:
#   SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: "gcp"
#   MY_OTHER_VARIABLE: "value"
